# Prediction-of-Product-Sales
This project aims to predict product sales using a [dataset](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/). The dataset contains information about various products and their sales across different outlets. The project involves data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset before building predictive models.
   -  This first project will be a sales prediction for food items sold at various stores.
   -  With these graphs and models, we can predict future product sales for our clients.

## Business problem
The goal is to help the retailer understand the properties of products and outlets that play crucial roles in predicting sales.

## Methods
*   The following methods were used to clean and prepare the data for machine learning:
      -   Data Cleaning: The data was cleaned by looking for and removing duplicates, identifying null values and filling them with placeholders for EDA, and fixing inconsistencies in categorical columns.
      -   EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted and including visualizing distributions with histograms and boxplots, counts for categorical columns, and a correlation heatmap to show variable relationships.
      -   Feature Inspection: Feature inspection was completed on all features, and included univariate and multivariate visualizations to show important factors that impact sales.
      -   Machine Learning Pre-Processing: Pre-processing was completed on the data to prepare it for machine learning and inlcuded imputing the mean for numeric null values, imputing a placeholder value of "Missing" for categorical null values, OneHot and Ordinal encoding of categorical features, and scaling of numeric and ordinal features after encoding.
      -   Modeling: The following models were used to predict sales:
           *     Linear Regression
           *     Random Forest
           *     Tuned Random Forest

## Results

*   A heatmap is used to visualize the correlation between features in the dataset.
*   During the exploratory data analysis, a boxplot and histogram was visualized for each numeric datatype column.
*   A barplot was visualized for each categorical column.
