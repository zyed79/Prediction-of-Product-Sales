# Prediction-of-Product-Sales
This project aims to predict product sales using a [dataset](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/). The dataset contains information about various products and their sales across different outlets. The project involves data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset before building predictive models.
   -  This first project will be a sales prediction for food items sold at various stores.
   -  With these graphs and models, we can predict future product sales for our clients.
